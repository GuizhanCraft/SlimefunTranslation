# Some items (such as swords, armor, tools) may hae extra lore that is added by other plugins.
# SlimefunTranslation overrides all lore by default, but you can add the materials here to only override the covered lines.
# For example, an item with the lore:
#   - "Line 1"
#   - "Line 2"
#   - "Line 3 added by another plugin"
# And the item translation only covers the first 2 lines.
# If the item's material is not covered in this list, you will not be able to see the third line in translation.
# If the item's material is covered in this list, you can see only the first 2 lines are translated, and the third line is kept.
# -----
# For minecraft MATERIAL, write in "minecraft:material", e.g. "minecraft:stone".
# You can also use our tag system, in "sft:tag", e.g. "sft:pickaxe".
# A tag is a set of materials, so you do not need to write every material in the tag, just the tag.
# Check all the available tags here: https://github.com/ybw0014/SlimefunTranslation/tree/master/src/main/resources/tags
