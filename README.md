# SlimefunTranslation

[English](./README.md) | [简体中文](./README.zh-CN.md)

A [Slimefun4](https://github.com/Slimefun/Slimefun4) addon that translates Slimefun items (also supports addons). It does not modify the actual item, instead modifying the packets. The display language will be based on player's Slimefun language setting.
